# CS 300 Portfolio Submission

## Project One: Runtime and Memory Analysis  
For this project, I compared how vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees perform when it comes to inserting, searching, and printing data. I looked at the time it takes for each operation and how easy it is to use each structure when working with course data. After comparing them, I decided the binary search tree was the best fit because it keeps the data sorted and is still efficient to use.

## Project Two: Course Planner Application  
This project involved creating a course planner that can read course information from a file, show a list of all courses, or let the user search for one. I built it using a binary search tree so that the courses come out in order when printed, and the program can handle searches quickly.  

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving?  
I was building a system to help users view and search through course information in a way that’s fast and organized.

### How did you approach the problem?  
I tried out a few different data structures and tested how they performed. I picked the one that made the most sense for both speed and organization—the binary search tree.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks?  
I had to review how in-order traversal works and make sure my file reading code handled things cleanly. I also had to test for different input cases to make sure nothing broke.

### How has this project expanded your approach?  
It helped me think more carefully about which data structures to use and how the choice affects how the program runs and behaves.

### How has this project changed the way you write code?  
Now I pay more attention to writing code that’s easy to understand and update later. I also try to keep things clean and separated so that if I need to change something later, I can do it without a lot of trouble.
